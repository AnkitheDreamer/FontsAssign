            <p class="love">I found a love, for me</p>
            <p class="romantic">Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead</p>
            <p class="sweet">Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet</p>
            <p class="surprise">Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
            <p class="young-love">'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
            <p class="uncertainty">Not knowing what it was</p>
            <p class="determination">I will not give you up this time</p>
            <p class="intimacy">But darling, just kiss me slow</p>
            <p class="possession">Your heart is all I own</p>
            <p class="connection">And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
            <p class="dancing">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>
            <p class="embrace">With you between my arms</p>
            <p class="freedom">Barefoot on the grass</p>
            <p class="nostalgia">Listening to our favourite song</p>
            <p class="reassurance">When you said you looked a mess</p>
            <p class="whisper">I whispered underneath my breath</p>
            <p class="hearing">But you heard it</p>
            <p class="admiration">Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
            <p class="strong-love">Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know</p>
            <p class="dreams">She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home</p>
            <p class="future">I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
            <p class="children">To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>
            <p class="determined-love">We are still kids, but we're so in love</p>
            <p class="odds">Fighting against all odds</p>
            <p class="optimism">I know we'll be alright this time</p>
            <p class="support">Darling, just hold my hand</p>
            <p class="commitment">Be my girl, I'll be your man</p>
            <p class="future-vision">I see my future in your eyes</p>

            <p class="nostalgia">Listening to our favorite song</p>
            <p class="beauty">When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful</p>
            <p class="undeserving">I don't deserve this</p>
            <p class="admiration">Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
            <p class="dancing">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>

            <p class="angel">I have faith in what I see</p>
            <p class="realization">Now I know I have met an angel in person</p>
            <p class="perfection">And she looks perfect</p>
